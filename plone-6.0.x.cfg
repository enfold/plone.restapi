# On March 24 2022, all ES6 stuff was merged.
# Since then, mockup is no longer a Python package and is not pulled in by CMFPlone
# The plone.app.widgets pinned in 6.0.0a3 still tries to import it.
# So temporarily include the egg explicitly, until Plone 6.0.0a4 is out.
# Alternative would be to add plone.app.widgets to the checkouts.
